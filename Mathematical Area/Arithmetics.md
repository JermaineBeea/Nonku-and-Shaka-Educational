Here’s a cleaner, more structured, and corrected version of your document. I’ve improved clarity, fixed errors (multiplication examples used for division), and added missing explanations:

# Arithmetic Problems

Arithmetic problems test the basic numeric operations of **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.

---

## Principles of Arithmetic

* **Positive Numbers**: Numbers greater than zero.
* **Negative Numbers**: Numbers less than zero.
* **Zero (0)**: Zero is neither positive nor negative.

---

### **Addition (Sum)**

Addition is the act of increasing a number by another number.

* **Example:** `three [+3]` **add** `two [+2]` equals `five [+5]`.
* You can also use the word **sum**, which refers to the result of addition.

---

### **Subtraction (Difference)**

Subtraction is the act of decreasing a number by another number.

* **Example:** `five [+5]` **minus** `two [+2]` equals `three [+3]`.
* The result of subtraction is called the **difference**.

---

### **Multiplication (Product)**

* The product of two **positive numbers** is a **positive number**.

  * **Example:** `+3 × +2 = +6`.
* The product of two **negative numbers** is a **positive number**.

  * **Example:** `-3 × -2 = +6`.
* The product of a **positive number** and a **negative number** is a **negative number**.

  * **Example:** `+3 × -2 = -6`.

---

### **Division (Quotient)**

* The division of two **positive numbers** is a **positive number**.

  * **Example:** `+6 ÷ +2 = +3`.
* The division of two **negative numbers** is a **positive number**.

  * **Example:** `-6 ÷ -2 = +3`.
* The division of a **positive number** by a **negative number** (or vice versa) is a **negative number**.

  * **Example:** `+6 ÷ -2 = -3`.

✅ Would you like me to **add a section for key rules (sign rules summary)** and **a subcategory for each operation with more examples and practice problems**? Or should I **keep it as a concise reference guide**?
